            <h2>Welcome to the Game Picker!</h2>
            <p>Do you tremble before the cascade of unplayed games in your Steam library? Well, tremble no
                more! Your game picking days are over! The Game Picker 9000 is here to do all the picking for
                you.
                Simply enter your 17-digit steam ID in the field, hit submit, and in seconds you'll have a freshly
                selected
                game to play. If you're not pleased with the selection, press the Reshuffle button for another go-round.
                But
                don't press it too many times, or you'll end up just as indecisive as you were before!</p>
            <p>Happy gaming!</p>
